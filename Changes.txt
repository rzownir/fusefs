FuseFS CVS
==========

  * FuseRoot#size is optionally called to determine file sizes, should the
    user want a file size to be reported as anything other than 0.

FuseFS 0.4
==========

  * Stronger and more robust handling of editor swap files, but still
    incomplete.
  * Peppered with debug statements.
  * A bit cleaner method of calling ruby functions.
  * rf_rename fixed. Whoops!

FuseFS 0.3
==========

  * read_file borked FuseFS when a binary file was returned. Instead of using
    strdup, it now mallocs according to the returned size, as appropriate.
  * Addition of sample/openurifs.rb
  * 'touch file' emptied a file, since it opened and then released without
    writing. I added a 'modified' flag to fix this.
  * 'touch' method call added, and called when a program attempts to modify
    a file's time.
  * 'executable?' check added in case programmer wants to the file to report
    itself as executable to the filesystem.
  * vim and emacs swap files are not passed to FuseFS =).

FuseFS 0.2
==========

  * Fix call for deleting files from 'remove' to 'delete' to match API spec.
  * Addition of sample/yamlfs.rb
